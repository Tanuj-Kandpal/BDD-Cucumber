# Selenium Automation Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a Selenium automation framework for web application testing. The framework is designed to provide a structured approach to writing and executing automated tests using Selenium WebDriver.

## Key Features
- **Step Definitions:** Implemented step definitions for defining test scenarios using Gherkin syntax.
- **Page Objects:** Setup Page Objects to represent web pages and their elements, providing a clear separation of concerns between test code and page structure.
- **Runner File:** Provided a runner file for executing automated tests, allowing for easy integration with testing frameworks like Cucumber or TestNG.

## Getting Started
To get started with the framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Install Dependencies:**
3. **Update WebDriver:**
   Ensure that you have the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) installed and configured. You may use the provided automated Bot to update dependencies to the latest version.

## Usage
Once the framework is set up and dependencies are installed, you can start writing and executing automated tests using the provided features. Here's a basic example:

```python
# Example Test Scenario
from selenium import webdriver
from pages.login_page import LoginPage

# Setup
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
login_page = LoginPage(driver)

# Test Scenario
def test_successful_login():
 login_page.navigate_to_login_page()
 login_page.enter_username("username")
 login_page.enter_password("password")
 login_page.click_login_button()
 assert login_page.is_dashboard_displayed()

# Teardown
driver.quit()
